    <h2>Why LEGO is Special to Me</h2>
    <p>
      LEGO has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Each brick is an invitation to build something new, to imagine beyond limits, and to find joy in creation. But what makes LEGO truly special to me is their commitment to sustainability — especially their plant-themed sets made from plant-based plastics.

    <h2>Plant-Themed LEGO Sets</h2>
    <p>
      I love how LEGO has embraced eco-friendly materials, creating sets that feature trees, leaves, and other greenery made from sugarcane-based plastic. These sets are not just beautiful — they symbolize LEGO's efforts to build a more sustainable future.
